# LMSLCD2020
Logitech Media Server to LCD, use API Python 3 and Request

## Why this code
I wanted something to use a LCD 20x4 to show information from the Logitech Media Server.

I also wanted some things in the project:
* use python 3
* use request
* use json /API from the Logitech Media Server

## Main problem
I do not know how to have easy to understand help on the LMS API.
